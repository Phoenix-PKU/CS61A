Project 4 requires us to write a scheme interpreter.

Normal problems are easy, but extra and optional problems are 
very difficult for me.

I shall stop here and enhance the interpreter when I have a more
thorough understanding of functional programming.

Currently I am still not clear about (especially) environment frame,
quote and quasiquote.

Although I have roughly finished the interpreter, I am still not sure
about the structure of the program, like what does scheme_eval, scheme
_apply return? How the environment change when the program runs? And 
a lot of similar questions.

And optional q2 has not been solved, so there is a lot of further work
to do.
